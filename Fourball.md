# Fourball
The game of Fourball was invented by Steven Anderson, Drew Sleezer, Rob Sleezer, and Eric Wright in the mid 1990s. It was first played in the Sleezer backyard in Stillwater Oklahoma.

## Setup 
Fourball is played with three players on a level grassy _field_. Decide the boundary of the field - beyond this is _out of bounds_. Decide the number of _points to victory_ and the _order of players_ (note that with three players, there are only two possible orders, ABC and ACB).

Set the _basket_ in the center of the field. The basket is a medium-sized container such as a laundry basket, Rubbermaid tub, or a cardboard box. 

Set four _chairs_ in a square around the basket. The inside corners of these chairs mark the _inner court_. The width of the inner court should be at least 3 times the width of the widest side of the basket. The remainder of the field is the _outer court_. 

The _ball_ should be medium size and weight, such as as a volleyball, soccer ball, or kickball. 

Designate at least one _starting point_, usually at the far end of the field boundary.

## Offense
Use a random method to decide who the first _ball carrier_ will be. The first ball carrier takes the ball to the starting point, and the other players must touch one of the chairs until the ball carrier leaves the starting point. There is a 5-second time limit between when all players are in position and when the ball carrier must leave the starting point. If the ball carrier exceeds this, the ball is give to the next player in the rotation. 

### Scoring Points
The object of the game is to score the most points, and the first to score the _points to victory_ wins. A point is scored when a player causes the ball to touch the bottom of the basket. A player who does this receives a point regardless of whether the ball bounces out of the basket or moves the basket. A player does not receive a point if the ball touches only the sides of the basket. 

If a player intentionally deflects the ball and it touches the bottom of the basket, the player who deflected the ball receives a point. If the deflection was unintentional, the point is given to the last player who had possession of the ball. 

Players may move the ball by any means, including holding, running, throwing, bouncing, or kicking the ball. Players may stand or climb on the chairs to shoot or block the ball.

## Defense
The other two players may stop the ball carrier by any means except those prohibited by Foul Rules (see below). This includes blocking the ball carrier or taking the ball their hands. Grabbing or restraining other players is not allowed. 


### Downing
The most common and effective defensive tactic is to _down_ the ball carrier by touching the ball carrier with both hand below the waist at the same time ("two-below"). It is customary for the defender to call "down" when they do this. When the ball carrier is downed, play stops and the player who downed the ball carrier receives the ball at the location where the down occurred.

The ball carrier may be downed only when they are holding the ball. If the player tosses the ball into the air or is otherwise not holding the ball when a player touches them with two hands, the down doesn't count. It is common for the ball carrier to avoid a down by tossing the ball when a defender tries to down them. 

### Checking
The new ball carrier begins play by _checking_ the ball to another player. Checking is a method of giving the ball to a new ball carrier which ensures that all players are ready. To check the ball, the new ball carrier passes the ball to one of the other players (generally the previous ball carrier, or the other player involved the incident that lead to the checking) while saying “check”. The player then passes the ball back, and play begins the moment the ball carrier catches the ball. The players must stay outside arms’ length of the ball carrier until two seconds have passed (these are generally counted out loud as "one-mississippi two-mississippi") or the ball carrier takes a step.

No player may be in the inner court when the ball is checked. If the ball carrier was downed in the inner court, the new ball carrier checks the ball from nearest location in the outer court.

### The Basket
If the basket is knocked over or moved out of the inner court, play stops and the basket is reset. The ball carrier checks the ball to begin play again. If the basket is within the inner court but is not knocked over, play continues. 

If any of the chairs is moved or knocked over, play continues and it is reset only after play stops for some other reason (e.g. a point is scored, the basket is knocked over, a player is downed, or the ball goes out of bounds). Players may, out of the goodness of their heart, reset the chair mid play.

### Contact
If the ball is loose (i.e., not in anyone’s possession), players may make physical contact with each other only in an attempt to get the ball. For example, a player could knock a player aside while running toward the ball, but a player could not push a player down and then run after the ball.

## Fouls
Fouls are given to discourage certain playing behavior. If a player acquires two fouls, their score is reduced by one point. A player’s score can become negative due to fouls. Fouls are given for the following reasons:

1. If the ball carrier shoots the ball from the outer court and another player blocks it from the inner court, the blocking player receives a foul. When jumping, the player’s location is determined by the place from which he jumped (i.e., the last place his feet touched the ground). If both the ball carrier and the player are inside, no fouls are given.

2. If the ball goes out of bounds, the last player who touched it receives a foul and must retrieve the ball. The next player in the rotation becomes the new ball carrier. They begin play by checking the ball from the point where it went out of bounds. 

3. If a player makes excessive physical contact with another player in a way that does not relate directly to getting the ball, that player receives a foul. 

4. If a player jumps, runs, or moves their body over the basket in any way that could have been avoided, that player receives a foul. A player does not receive a foul if they moves over the basket in a way that could not have been avoided (e.g., being knocked over). A player blocking with only their hands or arms over or in front of the basket does not receive this foul.

5. If a player intentionally kicks the basket they receives a foul. Because this action deprives the ball carrier of a goal, the ball carrier is given a foul shot. For a foul shot, the ball carrier stands within arms’ length of a starting point, and the other two players must each be touching a chair with both hands. The ball carrier shoots the ball. The ball carrier may not take a step and the other two players may not remove their hands from the chairs until the ball touches the basket, the ground, a chair, or one of the players.
